## ðŸ“… 7-Day DevOps Learning Progress

**Days 1â€“7 Highlights:**
- Developed strong Bash scripting fundamentals: input validation, error handling, modular functions, and automation.
- Designed and debugged robust GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows:
  - Automated script execution, artifact upload, notifications, and log management.
  - Implemented error handling with `continue-on-error`, `if: always()`, and matrix testing strategies.
- Practiced secure, practical file handling and archiving (cron, log rotation, arrays, `tar`).
- Integrated static code analysis with ShellCheck for all Bash scripts, maintaining a clean and production-ready codebase.
- Built up a consistent habit of daily code commits, strong commit messages, and iterative documentation.
- Resolved real-world CI/CD problems: artifact failures, log collection, YAML bugs, permission issues.
- Started research and experiments in Dockerfile/containerization for future automation and deployments.

**Repository Structure:**
- `.github/workflows/` â€“ All CI/CD workflows (`ci.yml`, `deploy.yml`, etc.)
- `bash-scripting/` â€“ Bash basics, logging, and scripting automation projects
- `test/` â€“ Automated test scripts
- Comprehensive log and code organization, ready for further scaling and DevOps portfolio growth.

**Next Steps:**
- Deeper dive into Docker, container orchestration, and real-world deployment workflows.
- Expand automated notifications and secrets management in CI/CD.
- Begin monitoring, IaC, and advanced project automation.

_This portfolio is a work in progress. Each session builds on practical skills and industry habits, with daily reflections and improvements tracked transparently._
